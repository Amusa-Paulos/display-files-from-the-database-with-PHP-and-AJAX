# display-files-from-the-database-with-PHP-and-AJAX

Note: The HTML file can only be displayed on the PHP server because it contains PHP and it's extension is .php
How to display files 
1. Create an uploads (./uploads/) directory
2. put images, pdfs and video files in the directory
The database
3. You can either create a new database "files_database" and create "files" table in it and
4. populate it with names of files in the uploads folder and status of 1 or 0

OR

5. import the database in sql format in the "./database in sql format/" directory into the database you created
6. change the names of files in the "files" table with the names of files in the "./uploads" folder

Then you are done!, if you have any question feel free to ask me in the comment section of the video on YouTube
